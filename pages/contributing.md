Thank you for considering contributing to XXXXX. We look forward to your participation. We hope that sharing your experiences will benefit others who read and use our code.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

<details>

<summary class=readMe >New Users</summary>

The first thing to do is to register a user name with [GitHub]( https://github.com/ ).

Once you are registered with GitHun you can:

* Submit big reports and weh list requests on our GitHub issues pages
* Receive notifications of updates by email
* Make pull request on for code you would like merged into our project
* Join a community of over thirty million people who are developing new software
* And more

To join GitHub, you will need to supply a username and email address and to create a password. There are no charges for joining

After you have registered you can go to your [GitHub settings]( https://github.com/settings/profile ). Here you can add a photo and update your bio. It's a good thing to add at least some data - especially a photo and a location. These help your friends remember and know that it is really you.

You may now start contributing to our project with a few small but very helpful efforts.

In the top right hand corner of this page, you will see the 'Watch' and 'Star' buttons:

_note the [freeCodeCamp]( https://freecodecamp.com/ ) 'Watch' and 'Star' buttons at top right_

Please click both of these buttons for [XXXXX on GitHub]( https://github.com/xxxxxx/xxxxxx.github.io ).

Clicking 'Star' makes you feel good - and it lets the world know there is interest in our project. Clicking 'Watch' means you receive an email when there is an issue. Any time you start getting too many messages, you may click this button again to update your preferences.

</details>


<details>

<summary class=readMe >Joining the Team</summary>

After you are registered with GitHub, he next thing you can do is to request becoming a member of this organization. If you personally know a member then you might send them a request for an invitation. Anther way is to create an [issue on XXXXX]( https://github.com/xxxxxx/xxxxx.github.io/issues ).

After you accept the invite, you will be able to submit code and receive notifications.

For further details see GitHub's [Managing membership in your organization]( https://help.github.com/articles/managing-membership-in-your-organization/ )

</details>


<details>

<summary class=readMe >Displaying Your Pride</summary>

Once you are a contributor to the organization, a very nice thing you may do is set your membership to 'public'.

Got to [XXXXX People]( https://github.com/orgs/xxxxxx/people )

![github-people-screen-capture.png]( https://cdn.glitch.com/8f4ee7c6-c279-4f9f-8598-a145f33d2ea6%2Fgithub-people-screen-capture.png?1499556745948 =600x100 )
_Member options for GitHub organizations_

Setting your membership to public helps new users see that they are joining a team and not just helping a particular individual. It also helps with your user name popping up as a suggested contact in GitHub issues and other useful places.

***

Now that you are set up as a user and a member, let us explore the ways you may contribute to this project...

<summary class=readMe >Ways of Helping</summary>

_This section is under current development. Fingers crossed a few hundred more words will be added soon. Suggestions wanted._

This section is about:

* Testing new releases
* Bug reporting
* Wish list requests
* Writing and editing documentation
* Providing announcements of updates and user support in online forums


### Testing new releases

Before a release can move from a 'development' release to a 'stable' release. In our kind of work this usually requires a visual inspection. Visual inspections are very hard to automate and thus require patient humans to click all the buttons on a number of test files and document issues thy come across.


### Bug Reporting

#### Before reporting a bug

1. Search issue tracker for similar issues.
2. Try the latest version of the script

#### How to report a bug

1. Specify the script name and revision number of the script where the bug occurred.
2. Specify your browser version, operating system, and graphics card. (for example, Chrome 23.0.1271.95, Windows 7, Nvidia Quadro 2000M)
3. Describe the problem in detail. Explain how to reproduce the error. Explain what happened, and what you expected would happen.
4. Provide a small test-case (http://jsfiddle.net). If a test-case is not possible, provide a link to a live version of your application.
5. If helpful, include a screenshot. Annotate the screenshot for clarity.


### Wish List Requests

One of the most helpful things you can do is ask for new features = big or small. Getting this feedback provides significant motivation in open source projects.


### Writing and editing documentation

A big goal of this effort is to create user interfaces that are so clear and 'natural' that very little documentation is needed.

Nonetheless there is still much need for writing that explains:

* The features and benefits of the code.
* The origins and the problems the code is trying to solve
* Aspects of the code that may not be obvious


### Spreading the word

The greatest software in the world is not of much use if it is hidden under a rock. The existence of good software needs to be shared. The best thing you can do to help a project is to inform people in relevant online netwrks and to respond to request for help and to pass on what you learn back to the development team.

<summary class=readMe >Code Style Guide</summary>

All code and examples in XXXXX are written using Mr.doob's Code Style. Of course you are free to use whatever style you prefer for your own work, but if you are adding code to the library or examples then you must follow this guide.

You can find details here: [Mr.doob's Code Style]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Mr.doob%27s-Code-Style%E2%84%A2)
You can find examples here: [three.js / examples]( https://threejs.org/examples/ )

General guidelines include:

* Where possible and not unreasonable: all HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single file
* Preserve white space, let the code look and feel as if it is a poem on a sheet of paper
	* Allow the code to be read aloud
* Write code that is easy for beginners and non-programmers or read
	* Avoid the use of symbols
	* Do use words
